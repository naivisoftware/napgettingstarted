## Compilation

Copy 'myfirstproject' to the projects directory. Run regenerate to generate the solution for your target platform. This step skips the creation of a new application. It is recommended to watch the [Create Your Own App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkJADh-djs8&list=PLYsqyOa-LeUm8vR1FfM9-2_zCM9-cVkO9&index=4&t=211s) video first.
